# Self Evaluation

- How confident do you feel about your use of built-in Ruby methods?
*I feel very good today about all this. By the final practice I was able to write each code relatively quickly compared to the earlier documents. I really like adding in a paramater and then an argument to make specific message to specific people...my examples made me really laught today!*


- How confident do you feel writing simple methods of your own?
*I did all of the final practice today without my notes; well... just for the integer method. These simple methods are really great.*


- What questions do you have about methods, and what they are capable of? (ask a question!!!)
*Question1: I'm mainly confused on the terminology of everything and how to speak about them in sentences. For example, "What does "pass the method" mean? and element vs object, to call on a method or a method call on... etc.*

*Question 2: I do have a question though...when is a method a sort of suffix that's added onto a variable vs being printed directly?*
*For example: " variable.split " vs " puts hello_greeting " // we can't type " puts .split "*
